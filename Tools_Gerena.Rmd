# 8-30-23 Measures of Disease Frequency
![Sample Size Table by Roe and Cannon (1982)](Images/ss_table.png)

# Questions
1. 59 Deer
2. 95% confidence at 1% prevalence required 70 more deer than 99% confidence at 2% prevalence.
3. <1% prevalence
4. 
Lee County: 20% prevalence (+/-13%)
Chambers County: 26.7% prevalence (+/-31.8%)
Russell County: 3.1% prevalence (+/-7.8%)

**Comparison of prevalences by Fisher's exact test**

                                  N  Infected Non-inf.   Prev.%
Chambers.Turkey$lameness          30       8      22      26.7 
Lee.Turkey$lameness              150      30     120      20.0 
Russell.Turkey$lameness           96       3      93       3.1 

     Two-sided p-value: <0.0001 
This p-value is significant, suggesting that prevalence of lameness in these three counties is significantly different. It should be noted that Chambers County has a large confidence interval that is likely a result of the small sample size potentially biasing results. Further tests are needed to evaluate this.
